#textos
textohumano = Humans: They are the most abundant race in the area. They are physically pretty standard. They are very persevering and achieve great things, probably because they have shorter lifespans compared to other races. This impetus and the fact of being the most numerous race, makes them believe that they are capable of convincing others with ease, which allows them to be good speakers. Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +1, Agility: +1, Vigor: +1, Magic: +0, Blarney: +2
textoelfo = Elves: They are quite cheerful, but often prefer small towns to big cities. Physically they do not stand out for their strength, but they have quite surprising agility.

Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +0, Agility: +3, Vigor: +0, Magic: +2, Blarney: +0
textoenano = Dwarves: They don't like people in general, they prefer to be in their mines extracting ore than taking a walk around the city and chatting.

Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +2, Agility: +0, Vigor: +3, Magic: +0, Blarney: +0

Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +0, Agility: +2, Vigor: +0, Magic: +0, Blarney: +3
textognomo = Gnome: They are quite small in size, often not reaching a meter in height. Their small stature allows them some agility, but their real strength is magic.

Its advantages in terms of attributes are the following: Strength: +0, Agility: +1, Vigor: +0, Magic: +4, Blarney: +0
textosoldado = Soldier: Warriors trained in the art of war. Many have other jobs, since soldiering often does not bring them much money, since, despite risking their lives in battle, in times of peace they do not have much to do. The hard training gives them good physical strength, as well as experience in the use of weapons. Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +3, Agility: +3, Vigor: +4, Magic: +0, Blarney: +0
textonomada = Nomad: They are generally members of tribes that are dedicated to migrating from one land to another.

textocazador = Hunter: They usually live in forests or areas far from civilization, although they often come to cities to trade.

Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +3, Agility: +2, Vigor: +3, Magic: +2, Blarney: +0
textoladron = Thief: They are dedicated to making a living at the expense of the goods of others. From a young age they are dedicated to breaking the law in one way or another.

Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +0, Agility: +3, Vigor: +2, Magic: +0, Blarney: +5
textomago = Wizard: Experts in the art of manipulating the arcane. They are scholars who spend their lives dedicating themselves to discovering the ins and outs of magic. Since the study of magic often involves visiting dangerous places to obtain rare ingredients or secrets of ancient magic, they have a fair physical aptitude for seeking adventure. Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +0, Agility: +2, Vigor: +1, Magic: +5, Blarney: +2
textobrujo = Warlock: They usually live in the woods or some place far from civilization so they can experiment to their heart's content without being bothered.

Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +0, Agility: +2, Vigor: +1, Magic: +4, Blarney: +3
textoermitanio = Hermit: They are marginalized from society because of their oddities. They have a natural ability for magic, but often do not have full control over it. Many end up having side effects such as malformations or psychological problems. However, until their nature is discovered they may seem normal and convince others to help them. Its advantages in terms of attributes are as follows: Strength: +1, Agility: +2, Vigor: +3, Magic: +3, Blarney: +1

#textosAventura
exito = SUCCESS!
fallo = FAILURE!
mision1Pagina1 = You are an adventurous person who likes to travel to different regions just for the sake of discovering what destiny will bring you. You are an orphan and since you were little you have been on your own learning about everything from the people you met. You have had various trades, but now you dedicate yourself to looking for orders so as not to starve. You are currently in a small town that according to rumors suffers many misfortunes. It is said that it may be being assaulted by monsters. You go to the tavern and soon find out that some orcs have settled in a cave a short distance from the town. Apparently, they have been raiding the village for weeks, demanding tribute in exchange for sparing the lives of the villagers. In fact, on the wall of the tavern there is a sign that says that whoever brings the head of the orc chief will be rewarded accordingly. The town has no militia and they seem desperate to hire anyone for the job. It sounds like a perfect job for you, especially considering that you've been quite short of funds lately and you were already desperately needing to earn some money.
mision1Pagina2 = You tear off the paper banner and pocket it, intending to head straight for the orc cave. It doesn't take you more than an hour to get to the mountain where the cave is located and after a while you hear grotesque screams and laughter coming from a slope on the hillside. When you look carefully, you see that it is a group of three orcs who are sitting and eating around a fire that they have set up right at the entrance of what seems to be a deep grotto. As they eat they joke around hitting and yelling at each other in what might seem like a relaxed environment for an orc. You distinguish one of them as the one who should be the boss by his bulk and armor. They haven't seen you yet, you can decide what move to make next. You can come out of hiding and challenge the boss to a duel, or find a place from which you can attack the boss without being seen, or use some magic spell, or run away.
mision1Pagina3Opcion1Exito = You come out of your hiding place and try to convince the orc chief that if he can't accept a duel with you, it's because he doesn't even know how to use a sword. Hearing you, he can't resist the anger that runs through his veins for having been insulted like that and he gets up ready to fight you.
mision1Pagina3Opcion1Fallo = You come out of your hiding place and try to convince the orc chief that if he can't accept a duel with you, it's because he doesn't even know how to use a sword. Hearing you, he can't resist laughing and he asks you if you think he's going to fall for that clumsy attempt to provoke him. Without hesitation, he orders his henchmen to finish you off and they get up ready to finish as soon as possible.
mision1Pagina3Opcion2Exito = You manage to climb up some high rocks from which to attack from a distance without being detected. You find a good size rock and throw it on the head of the orc boss hitting him hard. He instantly falls to the ground and his minions, surprised by the sudden attack, flee in terror without looking back. The orc chief gets up in great pain and after finding out where you are he goes after you ready to take revenge for the blow.
mision1Pagina3Opcion2Fallo = When you are trying to move between the rocks you trip over a stone and fall on your face near where the orcs are. They immediately see you and get up ready to kill you without saying a word.
mision1Pagina3Opcion3Exito = You try to remember a sleep spell and start reciting the words and waving your hands. Soon you start to see magical flashes surrounding your hands and you aim towards the orcs. A bluish mist surrounds them and they soon fall asleep. When you get closer you notice that the orc boss is waking up, it seems that he was more resistant than the rest. Seeing you, he takes his axe and prepares to attack you without hesitation.
mision1Pagina3Opcion3Fallo = You try to remember a sleep spell and start reciting the words and waving your hands. You get nothing and what's worse the orcs have heard you and have risen ready to face you.
mision1Pagina3Opcion4Exito = You turn around where you came from and run back to the town. You decide that this mission is too much for you and that you will find something more affordable in the next town.
mision1Pagina3Opcion4Fallo = You try to get out of there but just as you are leaving you hear how they shout in alarm because they have discovered you. When you turn you see how everyone gets up and comes after you to attack you.
